# 🏋️ TrainiAI – Personalized Plan Generator

**TrainiAI** is an intelligent voice-powered platform that helps users build personalized workout and diet plans through natural conversations. No forms. No fluff. Just a friendly AI that understands your needs and delivers a plan tailored to your lifestyle and goals.

## 🌟 What It Does

- 🎙️ Users speak naturally to an AI coach powered by VAPI
- 🧠 The assistant asks targeted fitness-related questions
- 📝 Structured data from the conversation is analyzed
- 💡 Gemini AI processes the data to generate a detailed plan
- 📦 The final plan is saved to the database and shown in the user’s dashboard
- ✅ All of this happens **seamlessly** after one voice conversation

---

## 🧠 How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **User speaks** to the AI assistant via VAPI
2. **Structured conversation data** is returned after the call
3. **Gemini AI** takes over, analyzing user goals, injuries, preferences, etc.
4. A **personalized fitness plan** is created — both workout & diet
5. Plan is stored and **immediately visible in the user’s dashboard**

This gives the user a fully customized plan without typing a single word.
